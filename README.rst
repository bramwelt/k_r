The C Programming Language
==========================

My goal for this project is to work through Kernighan and Ritchie's ``The
C Programming Language`` and complete each example, and writing about
what I learn along the way.

The challenge is that each exercise can only be completed with the
knowledge learned from previous exercises. For example, it would be much
easier to use a stack data structure to check for matching parenthesis
in exercise ``1-22.c``, but K&R have not talked about structs yet.
